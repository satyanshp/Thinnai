I was very excited and I had decided on surprising my friends, nobody knew where we were going. I was sure that everyone was going to love the place and they did. The place had this very rustic and vintage vibe which was cherry on top. The dinner place looked so cozy and beautiful that two hours seemed too less to enjoy. The in-house help was very considerate and well mannered. Totally loved the experience.Thank you so much!",
